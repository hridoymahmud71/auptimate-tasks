### Explanation of diagram.png

In this  diagram, the existing components from the current diagram are retained, including the Web UI, API Gateway, Account Service, Investment Service, Database, and Reporting Service.

The interactions between the components have been expanded to include the following:

The Web UI interacts with the Account Service for user registration, authentication, and management.

The Web UI interacts with the Investment Service to view investment pools and perform transactions.

The Web UI interacts with Reporting Service to view reports.
The Account Service and Investment Service communicate to create and manage investment pools.

The Investment Service and Account Service communicate to update investment amounts, distributions, and transactions.

The Account Service and Investment Service communicate to manage investor participation.

The Investment Service and Account Service communicate to retrieve investor information.

The Account Service, Investment Service, and Reporting Service interact with the Database for data storage and retrieval.

This architecture ensures scalability by distributing the workload across multiple instances of the Account Service, Investment Service, and Reporting Service. The Database can be scaled horizontally to handle increased data storage and retrieval requirements.


To ensure reliability, redundancy and failover mechanisms can be implemented for the Account Service, Investment Service, and Reporting Service. Load balancing can be used to distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of these services.


Security measures should be implemented at various levels, including secure communication channels (HTTPS), authentication and authorization mechanisms, encryption of sensitive financial information, and adherence to security best practices.
