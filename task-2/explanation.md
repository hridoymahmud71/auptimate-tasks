Data Structures:

The system uses a simple class, Transaction, to represent each transaction, containing the investor ID and the transaction amount.
It maintains an array of transactions to record all incoming transactions.
For the "Transaction Spike Alert," it maintains a separate array, recentTransactions, to keep track of recent transactions within a specified time window.
Algorithms:

When a new transaction is recorded, the system checks if the transaction amount is higher than a predefined threshold. If it is, it emits a "High Transaction Amount Alert."
For the "Transaction Spike Alert," the system continuously calculates the rate of transactions within the specified time window and checks if there is a sudden spike. If a spike is detected, it emits a "Transaction Spike Alert."
This simplified prototype uses event handling to emit alerts, but in a real system, you would likely integrate it with databases, message queues, and potentially machine learning models for more advanced anomaly detection.

Overall, the system employs a straightforward algorithm to monitor and identify unusual activities based on transaction amounts and transaction rates within a specified time window. It's designed to quickly alert fund managers to take appropriate actions when such activities occur.

---------------------------------------

The real-time alerting system is designed to monitor and detect unusual transaction activities within syndicates. It does so by tracking two specific scenarios:

1. High Transaction Amount Alert Algorithm:
Whenever a new transaction is recorded, the system checks if the transaction amount exceeds a predefined threshold.
Means if an investor makes a transaction with an unusually high amount, it triggers an alert.

1. Transaction Spike Alert Algorithm:
The system also keeps track of recent transactions within a specified time window (e.g., the last hour). It continuously calculates the rate of transactions and checks for a sudden spike (e.g., 10 times the average rate).
Means if there is a sudden surge in the number of transactions within a short period, it triggers an alert.
